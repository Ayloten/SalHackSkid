r333mo making SalHackSkid_skid, a fork of SalHackSkid.

Ethius is the group that made the modifications to salhack and created SalHackSkid.

## Salhack
Salhack is a Forge mod made by ionar. Recently, ionar has made the decision to leave the project, and as such, this project is discontinued without a main developer. And therefore someone that wanted to buid the higway system on endcrystal.me decided to make this thing.

CleanMiner is maintained.
 
## Installation

CleanMinder is a forge mod for `1.12.2` that was based off Salhack. We provide already pre build jar files on our [release page](https://github.com/ionar2/salhack/releases). If you want to have changes before they get officially released check our [CI](https://github.com/ionar2/salhack/actions) out. (It builds a new jar file on every change we make.) To use salhack just drop the jar file in your mods folder and start forge. Have fun!

**Tip:** You can open the GUI containing all "tweaks" with your left arrow at default (You can change that later.)

## Support

If you have a bug or want to suggest a feature raise an issue on Github or contact us via our Discord server.

## Info

Some of the code is pasted and proper credits are not given, but atleast it's open source now? :)

There is no git history because it contains personal info.
